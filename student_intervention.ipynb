The main idea to create a predictve model using these characteristics is figure out if a student will need help or not. To achieve this it is necesary to create a mathematical model which allow us to predict this situation: SVM. First at all we have to train to understand that there's two kind or two classes of students, ones who fails and ones who succeed. The SVM will create a line between them both categories, this line will separate characteristics about students, and using advanced optimization processes the algorithm finds the best line which divide both classes. This line is based on few equidistant features-points of both categories, this points are called *suport vectors*.\n",
