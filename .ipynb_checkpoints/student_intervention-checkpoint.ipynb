    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",

The main idea to create a predictve model using these characteristics is figure out if a student will need help or not.To achieve this it is necesary to create a mathematical model which allow us to predict this situation.  First at all we have to train a machine to understand that there's two kind or two classes of students, ones who fails and ones who succeed and create a line between them. This line separate characteristics about students, and using advanced optimization processes an algorithm finds the best line which divide both classes. Then using that imaginary line we are going to be able to figure out if a studunte will need help based just on few personal characteristics."
